## ShortLink - URL shortening service

### Description

ShortLink is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as http://www.sanergy.com/pages/about-creative/ and it returns a short URL such as http://short.est/GeAi9K.

### Tasks

-   Implement the designs found in **the Design folder** with a frontend framework of your choice (we recommend React, Angular or Vue). **Note** the provided designs are not meant to be implemented pixel perfect, the functionality is more important.
-   Implement the API using C#/.NET, PHP or Java

    -   Two endpoints are required
        -   /encode - Encodes a URL to a shortened URL
        -   /decode - Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
    -   Use JSON to communicate between API and frontend

-   There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to make sure that a URL can be encoded to a short URL and the short URL can be decoded to the original URL. **You do not need to persist short URLs to a database. Keep them in memory.**
-   Connect the frontend to the API using XHR and make sure the functionality outlined in the designs works as expected
-   Provide detailed instructions on how to run your assignment in a separate markdown file

### Evaluation Criteria

-   Design and functionality implemented according to attached files in **Design**
    -   Bonus: Copy to clipboard on button click
-   API implemented featuring a /encode and /decode endpoint
-   Frontend connected to API
